d(end to end) = N * (L/R) - end to end delay for single packet
Generalize for P packets over N links
The total delay will be given by the time it takes for the source to start sending the last packet plus the time it takes for the last packet
to propagate.
The last packet will be reached after (or the earlier packets will have been sent) (P-1)*(L/R) - (It takes 0*(L/R) to start sending 1st packet,
1*(L/R) to start sending 2nd packet, and so on...)
The last packet then follows the first formula for its delay:N*(L/R).
The sum of these is N*(L/R)+(P-1)(L/R) = (N+P-1)*(L/R)
