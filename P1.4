(a) Max number of simultaneous connections in fig. 1.13
16 (all switches connecting to "adjacent" switches)
(b) Max simultaneous if all connections are between A and C
8, since each connection will require two links each
(c)Can we make 4 connections between A and C as well as 4 between B and D
Yes, designate two links of each quartet to creating an A-C link, and the other two to creating a B-D link. This allows 4 connections of
each
For instance, if we assign the inner two link "squares" to B-D links, and the outer two to A-C links, the result will be a possible
four of each connection
