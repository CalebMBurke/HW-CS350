(a) A and B connected by single link of rate R bps, m meters long, propagation speed is s meters/second. Packet size L bits
    Propagation Delay: m/s
(b) Transmission Time: L/R
(c) End to end delay (ignoring processing and queueing delays) = m/s + L/R
(d) At time t = transmission delay, the last bit of the packet being sent will be at Host A, just about to enter the link
(e) If the propagation delay is greater than the transmission delay, at time t = transmission delay, the first bit of the packet will be
    (L/R) \* s, representing the speed of propagation multiplied by the transmission delay
(f) If the propagation delay is less than the transmission time, at time t = transmission time the first bit of the packet will be at host
B
(g)
