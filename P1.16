N - average number of packets in the buffer plus packets being transmitted
a - the rate of packets arriving at the link
d - the average total delay (queueing plus transmission delay) experienced by a packet
Little's Formula = N = a \* d
if N = 10 packets, transmission rate is 100 packets/sec, average queueing delay is 10 msec
transmission delay = 1/100 = 0.01 seconds per packet
Then d = 10 msec + 10 msec = 20 msec
and then N = a \* d gives 10 packets = a \* 20 msec
so a = 10 packets / 0.02 sec = 500 packets/sec
